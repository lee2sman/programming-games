## Description

This week we continue our work on Pong in order to complete the game.

#  Objects

In our previous work with tables we used our tables as numbered lists, but we can also store values in a different way: With strings.

```lua
function love.load()
	--rect is short for rectangle
	rect = {}
	rect["width"] = 100
end
```

`"width"` in this case is what we call a *key* or a *property*. So the table `rectangle` now has the property `"width"` with a value of 100. We don't need to use strings every time we want to create property. A dot (.) is the shorthand for `table_name["property_name"]`.

```lua
function love.load()
	rect = {}
	-- These two are the same
	rect["width"] = 100
	rect.width = 100
end
```

Let's add some more properties.

```lua
function love.load()
	rect = {}
	rect.x = 100
	rect.y = 100
	rect.width = 70
	rect.height = 90
end
```

Now that we have our properties we can start drawing the rectangle.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.rectangle("line", rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height)
end
```

And let's make it move!

```lua
function love.load()
	rect = {}
	rect.x = 100
	rect.y = 100
	rect.width = 70
	rect.height = 90

	--Add a speed property
	rect.speed = 100
end

function love.update(dt)
	-- Increase the value of x. Don't forget to use delta time.
	rect.x = rect.x + rect.speed * dt
end
```

Now we have a moving rectangle again, but to show the power of tables I want to create multiple moving rectangles. For this we're going to use a table as a list. We'll make a list of rectangles. Move the code inside the `love.load` to a new function, and create a new table in `love.load`.

```lua
function love.load()
	-- Remember: camelCasing!
	listOfRectangles = {}
end

function createRect()
	rect = {}
	rect.x = 100
	rect.y = 100
	rect.width = 70
	rect.height = 90
	rect.speed = 100

	-- Put the new rectangle in the list
	table.insert(listOfRectangles, rect)
end
```

So now every time we call `createRect`, a new rectangle object will be added to our list. That's right, a table filled with tables. Let's make it so that whenever we press space, we call `createRect`. We can do this with the callback `love.keypressed`.

```lua
function love.keypressed(key)
	-- Remember, 2 equal signs (==) for comparing!
	if key == "space" then
		createRect()
	end
end
```

Whenever we press a key, L√ñVE will call love.keypressed, and pass the pressed key as argument. If that key is `"space"`, it will call `createRect`.

Last thing to do is to change our update and draw function. We have to iterate through our list of rectangles.

```
function love.update(dt)
	for i,v in ipairs(listOfRectangles) do
		v.x = v.x + v.speed * dt
	end
end

function love.draw(dt)
	for i,v in ipairs(listOfRectangles) do
		love.graphics.rectangle("line", v.x, v.y, v.width, v.height)
	end
end
```

And now when you run the game, a moving rectangle should appear every time you press space.

## One more time?

That was a lot of code in a rather short tutorial. I can imagine it can be quite confusing so let's go through the whole code one more time:

In `love.load` we created a table called `listOfRectangles`.

When we press space, L√ñVE calls `love.keypressed`, and inside that function we check if the pressed key is `"space"`. If so, we call the function `createRect`.

In `createRect` we create a new table. We give this table properties, like `x` and `y`, and we store this new table inside our list `listOfRectangles`.

In `love.update` and `love.draw` we iterate through this list of rectangles, to update and draw each rectangle.

## Functions in objects

An object can also have functions. You create a function for an object like this:

```lua
tableName.functionName = function ()

end

-- Or the more common way
function tableName.functionName()

end
```

___

## Summary
We can store values in tables not only with numbers but also with strings. We call these type of tables *objects*. Having objects saves us from creating a lot of variables.

## pong-5 ("The Class Update")

-   pong-5 behaves exactly like pong-4. The biggest advantage we gain
    from this update is in the design of our code.
-   Open up pong-5 to take a look at how we've reorganized the code
    using classes and objects.

### What is a class?

-   A class is essentially a container for attributes (i.e., values or
    fields) and methods (i.e., functions). You can think of it as a
    blueprint for creating bundles of data and code that are related to
    each other.
-   Ex: A "Car" class can have "attributes" that describe its brand,
    model, color, miles, and anything else descriptive. Similarly, a
    "Car" class can also have "methods" that define its behavior, such
    as "accelerate", "turn", "honk", and more, which take the form of
    functions.
-   Objects are instantiated from these class blueprints, and it's these
    concrete objects that are the physical "cars" you see on the road,
    as opposed to the blueprints that may exist in the factory.
-   Our Paddles and Ball are perfect simple use cases for taking some of
    our code and bundling it together into classes and objects.
-   In Lua, class filenames are capitalized by convention, which helps
    you differentiate between any classes and libraries which you might
    be including in the same directory as your
    `main.lua` file.
-   Also note that we `require`
    our class files in `main.lua`
     just as we do for libraries. Additionally, we
    `require` a
    `class` library which
    contains helpful functionality for object-oriented programming in
    Lua.

### Important Code

-   The main takeaway from this update is that we now have abstracted
    away from `main.lua` the
    logic relevant to paddle and ball mechanics. These are now in their
    own classes, so you'll see a few new files in the project directory.
    `Ball.lua` contains all the
    logic specific to the ball, while `Paddle.lua`
     contains all the logic specific to each paddle.
    You'll also find `class.lua`
    which is what allows us to do this.
-   This not only gives us greater flexibility moving forward, it also
    makes our `main.lua` file
    cleaner and more readable.

## pong-6 ("The FPS Update")

-   pong-6 adds a title to our screen and displays the FPS of our
    application on the screen as well

### Important Functions

-   `love.window.setTitle(title)`
    
    -   This function sets the title of our application window, adding a
        slight level of polish.
-   `love.timer.getFPS()`
    -   Returns the current FPS (frames per second) of our application,
        making it easy to monitor when printed.

### Important Code

-   Our first addition to the code is in
    `love.load()`:

    ``` highlight
      love.window.setTitle('Pong')
    ```

    This quick and easy one-liner sets the title of our window.

-   Our second addition to the code is at the very bottom of
    `main.lua`. We define a
    helper function to display our FPS onto the screen:

    ``` highlight
      function displayFPS()
          love.graphics.setFont(smallFont)
          love.graphics.setColor(0, 255/255, 0, 255/255)
          love.graphics.print('FPS: ' .. tostring(love.timer.getFPS()), 10, 10)
      end
    ```

    We then call this helper function in
    `love.draw()`.

## pong-7 ("The Collision Update")

-   pong-7 allows for the Ball to bounce off the Paddles and window
    boundaries.
-   Open up pong-7 to take a look at how we've incorporated AABB
    Collision Detection into our Pong program.

### AABB Collision Detection

-   AABB Collision Detection relies on all colliding entities to have
    "axis-aligned bounding boxes", which simply means their collision
    boxes contain no rotation in our world space, which allows us to use
    a simple math formula to test for collision:

    ``` highlight
      if rect1.x is not > rect2.x + rect2.width and
          rect1.x + rect1.width is not < rect2.x and
          rect1.y is not > rect2.y + rect2.height and
          rect1.y + rect1.height is not < rect2.y:
          collision is true
      else
          collision is false
    ```

    Essentially, the formula is merely checking if the two boxes are
    colliding in any way.

-   We can use AABB Collision Detection to detect whether our Ball is
    colliding with our Paddles and react accordingly.

-   We can apply similar logic to detect if the Ball collides with a
    window boundary.

### Important Code

-   Notice how we've added a `collides`
     function to our Ball class. It uses the above
    algorithm to determine whether there has been a collision, returning
    `true` if so and
    `false` otherwise.

-   We can use this function in `love.update()`
     to keep track of the ball's changing position
    and velocity after each collision with a paddle:

    ``` highlight
      if ball:collides(player1) then
          ball.dx = -ball.dx * 1.03
          ball.x = player1.x + 5

          if ball.dy < 0 then
              ball.dy = -math.random(10, 150)
          else
              ball.dy = math.random(10, 150)
          end
      end
      if ball:collides(player2) then
          ball.dx = -ball.dx * 1.03
          ball.x = player2.x - 4

          if ball.dy < 0 then
              ball.dy = -math.random(10, 150)
          else
              ball.dy = math.random(10, 150)
          end
      end
    ```

    Take special note of how we shift the ball away from the paddle
    first before reversing its direction if we detect a collision in
    which the ball and paddle's edges overlap! This prevents an infinite
    collision loop between the ball and paddle.

-   We also implement similar logic for collisions with the window
    edges:

    ``` highlight
      if ball.y <= 0 then
          ball.y = 0
          ball.dy = -ball.dy
      end

      if ball.y >= VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 4 then
          ball.y = VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 4
          ball.dy = -ball.dy
      end
    ```

## pong-8 ("The Score Update")

-   pong-8 allows us to keep track of the score.

### Important Code

-   Essentially, all we need to do is increment the score variables for
    each player whenever the ball collides with their goal boundary:

    ``` highlight
      if ball.x < 0 then
          servingPlayer = 1
          player2Score = player2Score + 1
          ball:reset()
          gameState = 'start'
      end

      if ball.x > VIRTUAL_WIDTH then
          servingPlayer = 2
          player1Score = player1Score + 1
          ball:reset()
          gameState = 'start'
      end
    ```

## pong-9 ("The Serve Update")

-   pong-9 introduces a new state, "serve", to our game.

### What is a State Machine?

-   Currently in our Pong program we've only talked about state a little
    bit. We have our "start" state, which means the game is ready for us
    to press "enter" so that the ball will start moving, and our "play"
    state, which means the game is currently underway.
-   A state machine concerns itself with monitoring what is the current
    state and what transitions take place between possible states, such
    that each individual state is produced by a specific transition and
    has its own logic.
-   In pong-9, we allow a player to "serve" the ball by not having to
    defend during their first turn.
-   We transition from the "play" state to the "serve" state by scoring,
    and from the "serve" state to the "play" state by pressing
    `enter`. The game begins in
    the "start" state, and transitions to the serve state by pressing
    `enter`.

### Important Code

-   We can essentially add our new "serve" state by making an additional
    condition within our `love.update()`
     function:

    ``` highlight
      if gameState == 'serve' then
          ball.dy = math.random(-50, 50)
          if servingPlayer == 1 then
              ball.dx = math.random(140, 200)
          else
              ball.dx = -math.random(140, 200)
          end
      elseif ...
    ```

    The idea is that when a player gets scored on, they should get to
    serve the ball, so as to not be immediately on defense. We do this
    by adjusting the ball velocity in the "serve" state based off which
    player is serving.

## pong-10 ("The Victory Update")

-   pong-10 allows a player to win the game.

### Important Code

-   We introduce a new state: "done", and then we set a maximum score
    (in our case, 10). Within `love.update()`
    , we modify our code that checks whether a point
    has been scored as follows:

    ``` highlight
      if ball.x < 0 then
          servingPlayer = 1
          player2Score = player2Score + 1

          if player2Score == 10 then
              winningPlayer = 2
              gameState = 'done'
          else
              gameState = 'serve'
              ball:reset()
          end
      end

      if ball.x > VIRTUAL_WIDTH then
          servingPlayer = 2
          player1Score = player1Score + 1

          if player1Score == 10 then
              winningPlayer = 1
              gameState = 'done'
          else
              gameState = 'serve'
              ball:reset()
          end
      end
    ```
-   When a player reaches the maximum score, the game state transitions
    to "done" and we produce a victory screen in
    `love.draw()`:

    ``` highlight
      elseif gameState == 'done' then
          love.graphics.setFont(largeFont)
          love.graphics.printf('Player ' .. tostring(winningPlayer) .. ' wins!', 0, 10, VIRTUAL_WIDTH, 'center')
          love.graphics.setFont(smallFont)
          love.graphics.printf('Press Enter to restart!', 0, 30, VIRTUAL_WIDTH, 'center')
      end
    ```
-   Finally, we add some code to
    `love.keypressed(key)` to
    transition back to the "serve" state and reset the scores in case
    the player(s) would like to play again.

    ``` highlight
      elseif key == 'enter' or key == 'return' then
          ...
          elseif gameState == 'done' then
              gameState = 'serve'

              ball:reset()

              player1Score = 0
              player2Score = 0

              if winningPlayer == 1 then
                  servingPlayer = 2
              else
                  servingPlayer = 1
              end
          end
      end
    ```

## pong-11 ("The Audio Update")

-   pong-11 adds sound to the game

### Important Functions

-   `love.audio.newSource(path, [type])`
    
    -   This function creates a L√ñVE2D Audio object that we can play
        back at any point in our program. It can also be given a "type"
        of "stream" or "static"; streamed assets will be streamed from
        disk as needed, whereas static assets will be preserved in
        memory. For larger sound effects and music tracks, streaming is
        more memory-effective; in our examples, audio assets are static,
        since they're so small that they won't take up much memory at
        all
    -   We will use this functionality to play a sound whenever there is
        a collision.

### What is bfxr?

-   bfxr is a simple program for generating random sounds,
    freely-available on all major Operating Systems.
-   We will use it to generate all sound effects for our Pong example
    and most other examples going forward.
-   [bfxr.net](https://www.bfxr.net/)
-   We've created 3 sound files and stored them in a sub-directory
    within pong-11.

### Important Code

-   You'll notice in `love.load()`
     that we've created a table with references to
    the 3 sound files we've added to our project directory:

    ``` highlight
      sounds = {
          ['paddle_hit'] = love.audio.newSource('sounds/paddle_hit.wav', 'static'),
          ['score'] = love.audio.newSource('sounds/score.wav', 'static'),
          ['wall_hit'] = love.audio.newSource('sounds/wall_hit.wav', 'static')
      }
    ```

    In this case, we are storing each sound as a "static" audio file
    because of how small they are. In the future, if using larger audio
    files, you might consider storing them as "stream" audio files so as
    to save on memory.

-   You should be able to find throughout the rest of
    `main.lua` function calls
    such as `sounds['paddle_hit']:play()`
     in locations corresponding to playing sound upon
    paddle collisions, wall collisions, and scoring points.

## pong-12 ("The Resize Update")

-   pong-12 allows our Pong program to support resizing the window.

### Important Functions

-   `love.resize(width, height)`
    -   This function is called by L√ñVE every time we resize the
        application; logic should go in here if anything in the game
        (like a UI) is sized dynamically based on the window size.
        `push:resize()` needs to
        be called here for our use case so that it can dynamically
        rescale its internal canvas to fit our new window dimensions.

### Important Code

-   In order to support resizing the game window, we'll first need to
    edit our window initialization in `love.load()`
     such that `resizable = true`
    :

    ``` highlight
      push:setupScreen(VIRTUAL_WIDTH, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT, WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, {
          fullscreen = false,
          resizable = true,
          vsync = true
      })
    ```

-   The next step is to overwrite `love.resize()`
     with its analog from the
    `push` library:

    ``` highlight
      function love.resize(w, h)
          push:resize(w, h)
      end
    ```

    And with that, we have a fully functioning game of Pong!
