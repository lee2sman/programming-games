## Description

# Detecting collision
Let's say we're making a game where you can shoot down monsters. A monster should die when it is hit by a bullet. So what we need to check is: Is the monster colliding with a bullet?

We're going to create a *collision check* function. We will be checking collision between rectangles. This is called AABB collision. So we need to know, when do two rectangles collide?

I created an image with three examples:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rectangles1.png">

It's time to turn on that programmer brain if you haven't already. What is going on in the third example that isn't happening in the first and second example?

"They are colliding"

Yes, but you have to be more specific. We need information that the computer can use.

Take a look at the positions of the rectangles. In the first example, Red is not colliding with Blue, because Red is too far to the left. If Red was a bit further to the right, they would touch. How far exactly? Well, if **Red's right side** is further to the **right** than **Blue's left side**. This is something that is true for example 3. 

But it's also true for example 2. We need more conditions to be sure there is collision. So example 2 shows we can't go too far to the right. How far exactly can we go? How much would Red have to move to the left for there to be collision? When **Red's left side** is further to the **left** than **Blue's right side**.

So we have two conditions, is that enough to ensure there is collision?

Well no, look at the following image:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rectangles2.png">

This situation agrees with our conditions. Red's right side is further to the right than Blue's left side. And Red's left side is further to the left than Blue's right side. Yet, there is no collision. That's because Red is too high. It needs to move down. How far? Till **Red's bottom side** is further to the **bottom** than **Blue's top side**.

But if we move it too far down, there won't be collision anymore. How far can Red move down, and still collide with Blue? As long as **Red's top side** is further to the **top** than **Blue's bottom side**.

Now we got four conditions. Are all four conditions true for these three examples?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rectangles3.png">

**Red's right side** is further to the **right** than **Blue's left side**.

**Red's left side** is further to the **left** than **Blue's right side**.

**Red's bottom side** is further to the **bottom** than **Blue's top side**.

**Red's top side** is further to the **top** than **Blue's bottom side**.

Yes, they are! Now we need to turn this information into a function.

First let's create two rectangles.

```lua
function love.load()
	--Create 2 rectangles
	r1 = {
		x = 10,
		y = 100,
		width = 100,
		height = 100
	}

	r2 = {
		x = 250,
		y = 120,
		width = 150,
		height = 120
	}
end


function love.update(dt)
	--Make one of rectangle move
	r1.x = r1.x + 100 * dt
end


function love.draw()
	love.graphics.rectangle("line", r1.x, r1.y, r1.width, r1.height)
	love.graphics.rectangle("line", r2.x, r2.y, r2.width, r2.height)
end
```

Now we create a new function called checkCollision(), with 2 rectangles as parameters.

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)

end
```

First we need the sides of the rectangles. The left side is the x position, the right side is the x position + the width. Same with y and height.

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)
	--With locals it's common usage to use underscores instead of camelCasing
	local a_left = a.x
	local a_right = a.x + a.width
	local a_top = a.y
	local a_bottom = a.y + a.height

	local b_left = b.x
	local b_right = b.x + b.width
	local b_top = b.y
	local b_bottom = b.y + b.height
end
```

Now that we have the four sides of each rectangle, we can use them to put our conditions in an if-statement.

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)
	--With locals it's common usage to use underscores instead of camelCasing
	local a_left = a.x
	local a_right = a.x + a.width
	local a_top = a.y
	local a_bottom = a.y + a.height

	local b_left = b.x
	local b_right = b.x + b.width
	local b_top = b.y
	local b_bottom = b.y + b.height

	--If Red's right side is further to the right than Blue's left side.
	if  a_right > b_left
	--and Red's left side is further to the left than Blue's right side.
	and a_left < b_right
	--and Red's bottom side is further to the bottom than Blue's top side.
	and a_bottom > b_top
	--and Red's top side is further to the top than Blue's bottom side then..
	and a_top < b_bottom then
		--There is collision!
		return true
	else
		--If one of these statements is false, return false.
		return false
end
```

Notice that the if-condition itself is a boolean value. `checkCollision` returns `true` when the if-condition is `true` and vise-versa. Therefore `checkCollision` can be simplified into the following form:

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)
	--With locals it's common usage to use underscores instead of camelCasing
	local a_left = a.x
	local a_right = a.x + a.width
	local a_top = a.y
	local a_bottom = a.y + a.height

	local b_left = b.x
	local b_right = b.x + b.width
	local b_top = b.y
	local b_bottom = b.y + b.height

	--Directly return this boolean value without using if-statement
	return  a_right > b_left
		and a_left < b_right
		and a_bottom > b_top
		and a_top < b_bottom
end
```

Okay, we have our function. Let's try it out! We draw the rectangles filled or lined based on  

```lua
function love.draw()
	--We create a local variable called mode
	local mode
	if checkCollision(r1, r2) then
		--If there is collision, draw the rectangles filled
		mode = "fill"
	else
		--else, draw the rectangles as a line
		mode = "line"
	end

	--Use the variable as first argument
    love.graphics.rectangle(mode, r1.x, r1.y, r1.width, r1.height)
    love.graphics.rectangle(mode, r2.x, r2.y, r2.width, r2.height)
end
```

It works! Now you know how to detect collision between two rectangles.

___

## Summary

Collision between two rectangles can be checked with four conditions.

Where A and B are rectangles:

A's right side is further to the right than B's left side.

A's left side is further to the left than B's right side.

A's bottom side is further to the bottom than B's top side.

A's top side is further to the top than B's bottom side.


# Tables and for-loops

## Tables
Tables are basically lists in which we can store values.

You create a table with curly brackets ({ }):

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {}

end
```

We just created a table called fruits. Now we can store values inside the table. There are multiple ways to do this.

One way is to put the values inside the curly brackets.

```lua
function love.load()
	-- Each value is separated by a comma, just like with parameters and arguments
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
end
```

We can also use the function `table.insert`. The first argument is the table, the second argument is the value we want to store inside that table.

```lua
function love.load()
	--Each value is separated by a comma, just like with parameters and arguments
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
end
```

So now after love.load our table will contain `"apple"`, `"banana"` and `"pear"`. To prove that, let's put the values on screen. For that we're going to use `love.graphics.print(text, x, y)`.

```lua
function love.draw()
	--Arguments: (text, x-position, y-position)
	love.graphics.print("Test", 100, 100)
end
```

When you run the game, you should see the text "test" written. We can access the values of our table by writing the tables name, followed by brackets ([ ]) (So not curly but square brackets!). Inside these brackets, we write the position of the value we want.

![](/images/book/7/table.png)
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/table.png">

Like I said, tables are a list of values. We first added `"apple"` and `"banana"`, so those are on the first and second position in the list. Next we added `"pear"`, so that's on the third position in the list. On position 4 there is no value (yet), since we only added 3 values.

So if we want to print `"apple"`, we have to get the first value of the list.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.print(fruits[1], 100, 100)
end
```

And so now it should draw `"apple"`. If you replace the `[1]` with `[2]`, you should get `"banana"`, and with `[3]` you get `"pear"`.

Now we want to draw all 3 fruits. We could use love.graphics.print 3 times, each with a different table entry...

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.print(fruits[1], 100, 100)
	love.graphics.print(fruits[2], 100, 200)
	love.graphics.print(fruits[3], 100, 300)
end
```

...but imagine if we had 100 values in our table. Luckily, there's a solution for this: for-loops!

___

## for-loops

A for-loop is a way to repeat a piece of code a certain amount of times.

You create a for-loop like this:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")

	for i=1,10 do
		print("hello", i)
	end
end
```

If you run the game you should see it prints hello 1, hello 2, hello 3, all the way to 10.

To create a for-loop, first you write `for`. Next you write a variable and give it a numeric value. This is where the for-loop starts. The variable can be named anything, but it's common to use `i`. This variable can only be used inside the for-loop (just like with functions and parameters). Next you write the number to which it should count. So for example `for i=6,18 do` will start at 6 and keep looping till it's at 18.

There is also a third, optional number. This is by how much the variable increases. `for i=6,18,4 do` would go: 6, 10, 14, 18. With this you can also make for-loops go backwards with -1.

Our table starts at 1 and has 3 values, so we will write:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")

	for i=1,3 do
		print(fruits[i])
	end
end
```

When you run the game you'll see that it prints all 3 fruits. In the first loop it prints `fruits[1]`, then in the second loop `fruits[2]`and finally in the third loop `fruits[3]`.

___

## Editing tables

But what if we add or remove a value from a table? We would have to change the 3 into another number. For that we use `#fruits`. With the #-sign, we can get the length of a table. The length of a table refers to the number of things in that table. That length would be `3` in our case, since we have 3 entries: `apple`, `banana`, and `pear` in our `fruits` table.

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}

	print(#fruits)
	--Output: 2

	table.insert(fruits, "pear")

	print(#fruits)
	--Output: 3

	for i=1,#fruits do
		print(fruits[i])
	end
end
```

Let's use this knowledge to draw all 3 fruits.

```lua
function love.draw()
	for i=1,#fruits do
		love.graphics.print(fruits[i], 100, 100)
	end
end
```

If you run the game you should see it draws all 3 fruits, except they're all drawn on the same position. We can fix this by printing each number on a different height.

```lua
function love.draw()
	for i=1,#fruits do
		love.graphics.print(fruits[i], 100, 100 + 50 * i)
	end
end
```

So now `"apple"` will be drawn on the y-position 100 + 50 * 1, which is 150. Then `"banana"` gets drawn on 200, and `"pear"` on 250.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fruits.png">

If we were to add another fruit, we won't have to change anything. It will automatically be drawn. Let's add `"pineapple"`.

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
end
```

We can also remove values from our table. For that we use `table.remove`. The first argument is the table we want to remove something from, the second argument is the position we want to remove. So if we want to remove banana, we do the following:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
	table.remove(fruits, 2)
end
```

When you run the game you'll see that banana is no longer drawn, and that pear and pineapple have moved up.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shift.png">

When you remove a value from a table with `table.remove`, all the following items in the table will move up. So what was on position 3 is now on position 2 in the table. And what was on position 4 is now on position 3.

You can also add or change the values inside the table directly. For example, we can change `"apple"` into `"tomato"`:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
	table.remove(fruits, 2)
	--The value of position 1 in the table becomes "tomato"
	fruits[1] = "tomato"
end
```

___

## ipairs

Back to the for-loops. There is actually another way, and an easier way to loop through the table. We can use an `ipairs` loop.

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
	table.remove(fruits, 2)
	fruits[1] = "tomato"

	for i,v in ipairs(fruits) do
		print(i, v)
	end
	--Output:
	--1, "tomato"
	--2, "pear"
	--3, "pineapple"
end
```

This for-loop loops, or what we also call *iterates*, through all the values in the table. The variables `i` tells us the position of the table, `v` is the value of that position in the table. It's basically a shorthand for `fruits[i]`. For example, in the first iteration the values for the variables  `i` would be `1` and `v` would be `"apple"`. In the second iteration, `i` and `v` would be `2` and `"pear"` respectively.

But how does it work? Why does the function `ipairs` allow for this? That is for another time. For now all you need to know is that `ipairs` is basically a shorthand for the following:

```lua
for i=1, #fruits do
	v = fruits[i]
end
```

Let's use `ipairs` for drawing our tables.

```lua
function love.draw()
	-- i and v are variables, so we can name them whatever we want
	for i,frt in ipairs(fruits) do
		love.graphics.print(frt, 100, 100 + 50 * i)
	end
end
```

___

## Summary
Tables are lists in which we can store values. We store these values when creating the table, with `table.insert`, or with `table_name[1] = "some_value"`. We can get the length of the table with `#table_name`. With for-loops we can repeat a piece of code a number of times. We can also use for-loops to iterate through tables.

# What is a game loop?

-   A game, fundamentally, is an infinite loop. During every
    iteration of that loop, we're repeatedly performing the following
    set of steps:

    -   First, we're processing input. That is to say, we're constantly
        checking: has the user pressed a key on the keyboard, moved the
        joystick, moved/clicked the mouse, etc.?
    -   Second, we need to respond to that input from the previous step
        by updating anything in the game that depends on that input
        (i.e., tracking movement, detecting collisions, etc.).
    -   Third, we need to re-render anything that was updated in the
        previous step, so that the user can see visually on the screen
        that the game has changed and feel a sense of interactivity.

## 2D Coordinate System

-   In the context of 2D games, the most fundamental way of looking at
    the world is by using the 2D coordinate system.

-   Slightly different from the traditional coordinate system you
    might've used in math class, the 2D coordinate system we're
    referring to here is a system in which objects have an X and Y
    coordinate (X, Y) and are drawn accordingly, with (0,0) being the
    top-left of the system. This means positive directions moving down
    and to the right, while negative directions move up and to the left.

## Game scope

-   We are aiming to recreate "Pong," a simple 2 player game in which
    one player has a paddle on the left side of the screen, the other
    player has a paddle on the right side of the screen, and the first
    player to score 10 times on their opponent wins. A player scores by
    getting the ball past the opponent's paddle and into their "goal"
    (i.e., the edge of the screen).

    ![](pong_example.png)
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pong_example.png">

## Project Procedure

-   First off, we'll want to draw shapes to the screen (e.g., paddles
    and ball) so that the user can see the game.
-   Next, we'll want to control the 2D position of the paddles based on
    input, and implement collision detection between the paddles and
    ball so that each player can deflect the ball back toward their
    opponent.
-   We'll also need to implement collision detection between the ball
    and screen boundaries to keep the ball within the vertical bounds of
    the screen and to detect scoring events (outside horizontal bounds)
-   At that point, we'll want to add sound effects for when the ball
    hits paddles and walls, and for when a point is scored.
-   Lastly, we'll display the score on the screen so that the players
    don't have to remember it during the game.

## pong-0 ("The Day-0 Update")

-   At this point, you will want to have downloaded the demo code in
    order to follow along. Be sure to pay attention to the comments in
    the code!
-   pong-0 simply prints "Hello Pong!" exactly in the center of the
    screen. This is not incredibly exciting, but it does showcase how to
    use L√ñVE2D's most important functions moving forward.

### Important Functions

-   `love.load()`
    -   This function is used for initializing our game state at the
        very beginning of program execution. Whatever code we put here
        will be executed once at the very beginning of the program.
-   `love.update(dt)`
    -   This function is called by L√ñVE at each frame of program
        execution; `dt` (i.e.,
        DeltaTime) will be the elapsed time in seconds since the last
        frame, and we can use this to scale any changes in our game for
        even behavior across frame rates.
-   `love.draw()`
    -   This function is also called at each frame by L√ñVE. It is called
        after the update step completes so that we can draw things to
        the screen once they've changed.
-   L√ñVE2D expects these functions to be implemented in
    `main.lua` and calls them
    internally; if we don't define them, it will still function, but our
    game will be fundamentally incomplete, at least if
    `update` or
    `draw` are missing! We'll
    take a look at two more functions below:
-   `love.graphics.printf(text, x, y, [width], [align])`
    
    -   Versatile print function that can align text left, right, or
        center on the screen
-   `love.window.setMode(width, height, params)`
    
    -   Used to initialize the window's dimensions and to set parameters
        like `vsync` (vertical
        sync), whether we're fullscreen or not, and whether the window
        is resizeable after startup. We won't be using this function
        past this example in favor of the `push`
         virtual resolution library, which has its
        own method like this, but it is useful to know if encountered in
        other code.
-   Now, with these puzzle pieces in mind, you can see how we're
    rendering "Hello Pong!" to the center of the screen:

### Important code

-   We initialize our game by specifying in the
    `love.load()` function that
    our 1280x720 game window shouldn't be fullscreen or resizable, but
    it should be synced to our monitor's own refresh rate.

    ``` highlight
      WINDOW_WIDTH = 1280
      WINDOW_HEIGHT = 720

      function love.load()
          love.window.setMode(WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, {
              fullscreen = false,
              resizable = false,
              vsync = true
          })
      end
    ```
-   Next, we overwrite `love.draw()`
     so that we can specify the text we'd like to
    render to the screen, in this case "Hello Pong!", along with
    coordinates for where it should be drawn.

    ``` highlight
      function love.draw()
          love.graphics.printf(
              'Hello Pong!',          
              0,                      
              WINDOW_HEIGHT / 2 - 6,  
              WINDOW_WIDTH,           
              'center')             
      end
    ```

## pong-1 ("The Low-Res Update")

-   pong-1 exhibits the same behavior as pong-0, but with much blurrier
    text.

### Important Functions

-   `love.graphics.setDefaultFilter(min, mag)`
    
    -   This function sets the texture scaling filter when minimizing
        and magnifying textures and fonts; L√ñVE's default is bilinear,
        which causes blurriness, but for our use cases we will typically
        want nearest-neighbor filtering (`nearest`
        ), which results in perfect pixel upscaling
        and downscaling, simulating a retro feel.
-   `love.keypressed(key)`
    -   This is a L√ñVE2D callback function that executes whenever we
        press a key, assuming we've implemented this in
        `main.lua`, in the same
        vein as `love.load()`,
        `love.update(dt)`, and
        `love.draw()`. It'll
        allow us to receive input from the keyboard for our game.
-   `love.event.quit()`
    -   This is a simple function that terminates the application upon
        execution.

### Important Code

-   When you open pong-1, you'll notice that we've begun using the
    `push` library we referred
    to earlier. You can "import" other files in your
    `main.lua` file with the
    `require` keyword given that
    they are in the same directory.

-   In addition, we've also added two new variables to the code:

    ``` highlight
      push = require 'push'

      WINDOW_WIDTH = 1280
      WINDOW_HEIGHT = 720

      VIRTUAL_WIDTH = 432
      VIRTUAL_HEIGHT = 243
    ```

    This will allow us to think of our game in more low-res terms, by
    using the `push` library to
    treat our game as if it were on a 432x243 window, while actually
    rendering it at our desired 1280x720 window. With this change, we
    can see we've updated our `love.load()`
     function accordingly:

    ``` highlight
      function love.load()
          love.graphics.setDefaultFilter('nearest', 'nearest')

          push:setupScreen(VIRTUAL_WIDTH, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT, WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, {
              fullscreen = false,
              resizable = false,
              vsync = true
          })
      end
    ```

-   We've also added a way to quit the game via user input, by using two
    of the functions discussed above:

    ``` highlight
      function love.keypressed(key)
          if key == 'escape' then
              love.event.quit()
          end
      end
    ```

    Including this code in `main.lua`
     will ensure that the program is always
    monitoring whether the user has pressed the
    `escape` key on their
    keyboard, in which case `love.event.quit()`
     will be called to terminate the program.

-   Lastly, we've made a small tweak to our
    `love.draw()` function so as
    to integrate the `push`
    library into the code.

    ``` highlight
      function love.draw()
          push:apply('start')
          love.graphics.printf('Hello Pong!', 0, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 2 - 6, VIRTUAL_WIDTH, 'center')
          push:apply('end')
      end
    ```

    You'll notice that our print statement remains unchanged, but we've
    wrapped it between `push:apply('start')`
     and `push:apply('end')`
     to ensure that its contents will be rendered at
    our desired virtual resolution.

-   With these changes, you'll notice that while we're still printing
    "Hello Pong!" to the center of the screen, the text is now magnified
    and rendered at a lower resolution, despite our window size being
    the same as before.

## pong-2 ("The Rectangle Update")

-   pong-2 produces a more complete, albeit static image of what our
    Pong program should look like.

### Important Functions

-   `love.graphics.newFont(path, size)`
    
    -   This function loads a font file into memory at a specific path,
        setting it to a specific size, and storing it in an object we
        can use to globally change the currently active font that L√ñVE2D
        is using to render text (functioning like a state machine).
-   `love.graphics.setFont(font)`
    
    -   This function sets L√ñVE2D's currently active font (of which
        there can only be one at a time) to a passed-in
        `font` object that we
        can create using `love.graphics.newFont`
        , per the above.
-   `love.graphics.clear(r, g, b, a)`
    
    -   This function wipes the entire screen with a color defined by an
        RGBA set, with each component ranging from 0-255.
-   `love.graphics.rectangle(mode, x, y, width, height)`
    
    -   Draws a rectangle onto the screen using whichever our active
        color is (per `love.graphics.setColor`
        , which we don't need to use in this
        particular project since most everything is white, the default
        L√ñVE2D color). The `mode`
         parameter can be set to
        `fill` or
        `line`, which results in
        a filled or outlined rectangle, respectively, and the other four
        parameters are its position and size dimensions. This is the
        cornerstone drawing function of the entirety of our Pong
        implementation!

### Important Code

-   Alongside our `main.lua`
    file and the `push` library,
    you'll find that we've added a font file to our project.

-   On that note, you'll find a small addition to our
    `love.load()` function:

    ``` highlight
      smallFont = love.graphics.newFont('font.ttf', 8)
      love.graphics.setFont(smallFont)
    ```

    This will allow us to create a custom font object (based off the
    font file we've added to our project directory) that we can set as
    the active font in our game.

-   The only other changes to the code in this update can be found in
    the `love.draw()` function.

    ``` highlight
      love.graphics.clear(40/255, 45/255, 52/255, 255/255)

      love.graphics.printf('Hello Pong!', 0, 20, VIRTUAL_WIDTH, 'center')

      love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 10, 30, 5, 20)
      love.graphics.rectangle('fill', VIRTUAL_WIDTH - 10, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 50, 5, 20)
      love.graphics.rectangle('fill', VIRTUAL_WIDTH / 2 - 2, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 2 - 2, 4, 4)
    ```

    As you can see, we are setting the background to a dark color,
    shifting "Hello Pong!" higher up on the screen, and drawing
    rectangles for the paddles and the ball. The paddles are positioned
    on opposing ends of the screen, and the ball in the center.

## pong-3 ("The Paddle Update")

-   pong-3 adds interactivity to the Paddles by letting us move them up
    and down using the `w` and
    `s` keys for the left Paddle
    and the up and down keys for the right Paddle.

### Important Functions

-   `love.keyboard.isDown(key)`
    -   This function returns true or false depending on whether the
        specified key is currently held down; it differs from
        `love.keypressed(key)`
        in that this can be called arbitrarily and will continuously
        return true if the key is pressed down, whereas
        `love.keypressed(key)`
        will only fire its code once every time the key is initially
        pressed down. However, since we want to be able to move our
        paddles up and down by holding down the appropriate keys, we
        need a function to test for longer periods of input, hence the
        use of `love.keyboard.isDown(key)`
        .

### Important Code

-   You'll notice we've added a new constant near the top of
    `main.lua`:

    ``` highlight
      PADDLE_SPEED = 200
    ```

    This is an arbitrary value that we've chosen for our paddle speed.
    It will be scaled by DeltaTime, so it'll be multiplied by how much
    time has passed (in terms of seconds) since the last frame, so that
    our paddle movement will remain consistent regardless of how quickly
    or slowly our computer is running.

-   You'll also find some new variables in
    `love.load()`:

    ``` highlight
      scoreFont = love.graphics.newFont('font.ttf', 32)

      player1Score = 0
      player2Score = 0

      player1Y = 30
      player2Y = VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 50
    ```

    In particular, we've created a new font object that is of larger
    size so that we can display each player's score more visibly on the
    screen, and allocated two variables for the purpose of scorekeeping.
    The last two variables will keep track of each paddle's vertical
    position, since the paddles will be able to move up and down.

-   Next, you'll see that we've finally defined behavior for
    `love.update()`:

    ``` highlight
      function love.update(dt)
          if love.keyboard.isDown('w') then
              player1Y = player1Y + -PADDLE_SPEED * dt
          elseif love.keyboard.isDown('s') then
              player1Y = player1Y + PADDLE_SPEED * dt
          end

          if love.keyboard.isDown('up') then
              player2Y = player2Y + -PADDLE_SPEED * dt
          elseif love.keyboard.isDown('down') then
              player2Y = player2Y + PADDLE_SPEED * dt
          end
      end
    ```

    Here, we've implemented a way for each player to move their paddle.
    Recall that our 2D coordinate system is centered at the top left of
    the screen. Therefore, in order for each paddle to move upwards, its
    Y position will need to be multiplied by negative velocity (and vice
    versa), which might seem counterintuitive at first glance, so be
    sure to take a moment to look at this carefully.

-   Lastly, in `love.draw()`
    you'll see that we've added code for displaying the score on the
    screen:

    ``` highlight
      love.graphics.setFont(scoreFont)
      love.graphics.print(tostring(player1Score), VIRTUAL_WIDTH / 2 - 50, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 3)
      love.graphics.print(tostring(player2Score), VIRTUAL_WIDTH / 2 + 30, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 3)
    ```

    First we set the active font to be the larger of the two we've
    created, and then we display each player's score on their side of
    the screen.

## pong-4 ("The Ball Update")

-   pong-4 adds motion to the Ball upon the user pressing
    `enter`.

### Important Functions

-   `math.randomseed(num)`
    -   This function "seeds" the random number generator used by Lua
        (`math.random`) with
        some values such that its randomness is dependent on that
        supplied value, allowing us to pass in different numbers each
        playthrough to guarantee non-consistency across different
        program executions (or uniformity if we want consistent behavior
        for testing).
-   `os.time()`
    -   This is a Lua function that returns, in seconds, the time since
        00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970, also known as Unix epoch time
        ([en.wikipedia.ord/wiki/Unix_time](https://en.wikipedia.ord/wiki/Unix_time))
-   `math.random(min, max)`
    -   This function returns a random number, dependent on the seeded
        random number generator, between `min`
         and `max`
        , inclusive.
-   `math.min(num1, num2)`
    -   Returns the lesser of the two numbers passed in.
-   `math.max(num1, num2)`
    -   Returns the greater of the two numbers passed in.

### Important Code

-   You'll find our first addition to the code at the top of
    `love.load()`:

    ``` highlight
      math.randomseed(os.time())
    ```

    This seeds the random number generator, using the current time to
    ensure different random numbers each time our game is run. Beyond
    that, you'll see a few new variables near the bottom of
    `love.load()`:

    ``` highlight
      ballX = VIRTUAL_WIDTH / 2 - 2
      ballY = VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 2 - 2

      ballDX = math.random(2) == 1 and 100 or -100
      ballDY = math.random(-50, 50)

      gameState = 'start'
    ```

    `ballX` and
    `ballY` will keep track of
    the ball position, while `ballDX`
     and `ballDY`
     will keep track of the ball velocity.
    `gameState` will serve as a
    rudimentary "state machine", such that we'll cycle it through the
    different states of our game (start, play, etc.)

-   In `love.update()`, we tweak
    our code for paddle movement by wrapping it around the
    `math.max()` and
    `math.min` functions to
    ensure that the paddles can't move beyond the edges of the screen:

-   We also add new code to ensure the ball can only move when we are in
    the "play" state:

    ``` highlight
      if gameState == 'play' then
          ballX = ballX + ballDX * dt
          ballY = ballY + ballDY * dt
      end
    ```

-   Following this, in `love.keypressed(key)`
    , we add functionality to launch the game (thus
    transitioning from the "start" state to the "play" state) and
    implement ball movement mechanics:

    ``` highlight
      elseif key == 'enter' or key == 'return' then
          if gameState == 'start' then
              gameState = 'play'
          else
              gameState = 'start'

              ballX = VIRTUAL_WIDTH / 2 - 2
              ballY = VIRTUAL_HEIGHT / 2 - 2

              ballDX = math.random(2) == 1 and 100 or -100
              ballDY = math.random(-50, 50) * 1.5
          end
      end
    ```

    Once in the "play state," we start the ball's position in the center
    of the screen and assign it a random starting velocity.

-   Lastly, we tweak our `love.draw()`
     function so that we can see the changes from
    `love.update()` at each
    frame:

    ``` highlight
      if gameState == 'start' then
          love.graphics.printf('Hello Start State!', 0, 20, VIRTUAL_WIDTH, 'center')
      else
          love.graphics.printf('Hello Play State!', 0, 20, VIRTUAL_WIDTH, 'center')
      end

      love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 10, player1Y, 5, 20)
      love.graphics.rectangle('fill', VIRTUAL_WIDTH - 10, player2Y, 5, 20)
      love.graphics.rectangle('fill', ballX, ballY, 4, 4)
    ```

    The only changes of note are the displaying of different messages
    depending on the game state, and updating the previous print
    statements to use the variables dynamically keeping track of
    position, rather than static values.
