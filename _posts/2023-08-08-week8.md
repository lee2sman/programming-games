## Description

Instead of meeting on campus we will be visiting [Wonderville](https://www.wonderville.nyc/) in Brooklyn, NY. We will be playing locally-created games and meeting New York-based game developers.

You may want to watch a video about Killer Queen before visiting. It is the world's first 10 player arcade cabinet, and we will be having a tournament.
