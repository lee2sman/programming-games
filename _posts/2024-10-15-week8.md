## Description

This week we meet a game designer and learn about their work and approach to game-making, especially outside the world of Triple-A game production. After learning about game design, students participate in a game jam workshop and create new games collaboratively.

## Class notes

# Games! and things

We'll start by playing some games arcade-style.

[Wiz Boing](https://pumpkinclowning.itch.io/wizboing)

> *This is for a jam on Glorious Trainwrecks. The criteria was hats, spelunking, teleportation I made a rogue like, I think that's what you wanted, right?*

[Yoke Mart](https://yokemart.itch.io/)

This is dozens of games made quickly and commercially!

> *I can make you a digital toy or game in 10 minutes to a couple of hours! Development of these games is streamed here. Message me on twitter if you want one. $10 per 10 minutes.*

> by *April's Ghoul and Blake's Andrews*

[Binky Eats Cake](https://pumpkinclowning.itch.io/binky-eats-cake)

> *This Game I made a long time ago, but gisbrecht wanted me to post it here, so I remade the original and made it dragon ball themed and put the original here.*

[200 Games I Won't Play](https://pumpkinclowning.itch.io/games-i-wont-play)

Like a memo as manifesto!

> *I do not have to play Naughty Dog and Sony Computer Entertainment's The Last of Us. I refuse to have my time or money sucked away by media that does not enrich my life.*

# Game Designer: [Blake Andrews](https://pbjabcusa.com/)

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blake.jpg">

Blake Andrews is a game designer, illustrator, animator, adjunct instructor, and “sound guy” living in Brooklyn, New York. Blake has published hundreds of short experimental web games since 2013 on websites like itch.io and Glorious Trainwrecks. They have organized game jams and playtesting for NYU Game Center, Babycastles, Wonderville, and Come Out and Play.

Blake is co-creator (with Frank DeMarco) of the skateboard video game [Electric Scrapeboard](https://shampoo.ooo/scrapeboard/) that uses a skateboard as a physical controller. They will be demo-ing this and other alternative controller-based video games.

### Scrapeboard

> [Scrapeboard](https://shampoo.ooo/scrapeboard/) is a physical arcade game played with a skateboard deck and four metal floor pads. In the game, the player is a lizard who is given a skateboard deck autographed by Tony Hawk and challenged to face off against his goons. The object of each match is to perform combinations of moves on a skateboard deck as quickly as possible in order to block lethal sword attacks. *--[Scrapeboard Wiki](https://open.shampoo.ooo/scrape/scrapeboard/wiki)*

## Questions for Blake

*Submitted by students for Blake*

My question for Blake would be about their general process for making games. How is it possible for you to code so many games in such a short time frame? What are your first and last steps when coding? How does the amount of time you put into a game specifically change the outcome of the game? And finally, what are your main objectives when coding a game for a viewer?

What do you think makes a good game? Is there such a thing as a "good" or "bad" game?

When did you start making games, and did any game or game creator inspire you?

What is your goal when making a game? What do you want people to take away from the experience?

Favorite game of all time, and a game that disappointed you?

What is the inspiration behind the art style and theming of the games
 
How reliable is making games for a living wage?

What is the longest/biggest game Blake has made in terms of content and what was it for? What is their personal favorite project?

Did you ever previously do internships? If so, talk about your experience.

Why did you create New Jersey Transit have multiple bright colors? What was the aesthetic you were trying to pull off? 

## Game jam/workshop

* [2hr game jam club](https://2hrgamejamclub.itch.io/) on itch.io

Blake has led the monthly 2hr game jam at Babycastles and currently at Wonderville. Each month, game makers use simple to use game engines to finish a game rapidly. 

Game engines include TinyChoice, Bitsy, Construct3, Puzzlescript, Twine, HTML, Flickgame, and others.

## Code homework

For homework this week you will complete a draft version of your robotfindskitten-influenced wander game. (This is your pre-final draft. You should have collisions working, a level, background, working player character, objects to collect or interact with). After this week you will get to do a final revision.

* Create your own *clone* of robotfindskitten. Change the characters, objects, text, theme, sprites, background, map, etc. Make your own version of a game where a player character wanders around, finding items as they explore that they read about. 
* Add a background soundtrack and/or sound effects
* OPTIONAL: Use randomization so that each time you play the objects are placed randomly around the screen.

Your code should be complete, working, commented, and broken down into functions.

Your game should have sound effects.

The scene must have background graphics. Graphics should be consistent. 

The game should have a clear objective, rules and gameplay and be bug-free.
