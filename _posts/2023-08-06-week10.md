## Description

We'll pull together all of our skills thus far to build a platformer. We'll introduce physics and build complex levels for the player to explore.

## Class notes

## Character movement

The solution of making the player move is to change the players ```x``` and ```y```.

To do that we need to make 2 variables named ```x``` and ```y```, ```player = {x=0,y=0}``` after we do that we need to actually draw the sprite so we need to make a draw function.

```
player = {x=0,y=0}

function _draw()
 spr(1,player.x,player.y)
end
```

Now we need to change the player's x and y position.

```
player = {x=0,y=0}

function _update()
 if btn(‚Üí) then
    player.x += 1
 end
 
 if btn(‚Üê) then
    player.x -= 1
 end
 
 if btn(‚Üë) then
    player.y -= 1
 end
 
 if btn(‚Üì) then
    player.y += 1
 end

function _draw()
 spr(1,player.x,player.y)
end
```

That's it!

## Ennuigi game

> Spend some time with a depressed, laconic Luigi as he chain smokes and wanders through a crumbling Mushroom Kingdom, ruminating on ontology, ethics, family, identity, and the mistakes he and his brother have made.

```
Controls:

    left/right: walk around
    up: ruminate
    down: smoke
```

> About the game:

> This is a shot at a collection of ideas I had a few years ago, about looking critically at the universe of Super Mario Bros. in light of the total lack of explicit narrative in the original game in particular. Who are these strange men? What motivates them? By what right do they wreak the havoc they do on this strange place? What do they feel about where they are and what they're doing?

> And so, this is one lens through which to look at all that, with Luigi, the second brother, the also-ran, as a complicit onlooker, wandering now through some fractured, rotting liminal place in this strange world, reflecting on it all in scattered fragments.


## Random

```
rnd( [limit or table])
```

Random generates a random number under the given limit, or returns a random element from a sequence.

The limit is non-inclusive (i.e. the random value will top out below the limit number). The default limit is 1.0.

The <code>rnd()</code> function returns a random number in a range. The result ranges from 0.0 up the given *limit*, but will never be the *limit* value itself. For instance, <code>rnd(10)</code> can return from 0.0 up to 9.99999, but will never return 10.

The random number includes a fractional part. To get a random *integer*, use <code>flr(rnd(...))</code>.

If a sequence-style *table* is passed instead of a numerical *limit>, the <code>rnd()</code> function will return a random element from the sequence.

If no *limit* or *table* is supplied, it will default to a limit of 1.0. Values returned will range from 0.0 up to 0.99999 (0x0.ffff).

The random number generator is initialized with an unpredictable seed value when PICO-8 starts. The generator may be initialized with an explicit seed using ```srand()```, which permits a program to execute multiple times and always receive the same sequence of random numbers.

### Working with ranges that don't start at 0

To select a random number between a minimum and a maximum, call <code>rnd()</code> with the size of the range, then add the minimum:

```
scale    = rnd(20) - 10     -- a random number between -10 and 10
bomb.x   = 32 + rnd(64)     -- a random number between 32 and 96
die_roll = flr(rnd(6)) + 1  -- a random integer between 1 and 6
```

To select a random fraction with a fixed number of decimal digits, multiply the range by the number of values between whole numbers (e.g. 100 for two decimal digits), and then divide the result by the same amount:

```
earnings = flr(rnd(50 * 100)) / 100  -- between 0.00 and 50.00
```

### Examples 
```
print(rnd(20))       -- for example, 3.837

print(flr(rnd(20)))  -- for example, 17

-- note this is the same as rnd(0xffff)
print(rnd(-1))       -- for example, -1734.56 or 13744.63

print(rnd(split("hello",""))) -- h, e, o have 20% probability, l has 40% probability

print(rnd({5,6,7,8,21,10,31,256})) -- returns a random value from the table between table[1] and table[#table]
```

## Graphics

### Palette

PICO-8 starts up with both the draw and screen palettes set to the following indices & colors, with index 0 flagged as transparent in sprites and maps:

0	1	2	3
4	5	6	7
8	9	10	11
12	13	14	15

The draw palette may be altered by calling pal(draw_palette_index, screen_palette_index). This allows remapping sprite and map colors.

The draw palette's transparency flags may be altered by calling palt(draw_palette_index, true/false). This allows cookie-cutter style transparency in sprites and maps.

The screen palette may be altered by calling pal(screen_palette_index, system_palette_index, 1). This allows rearranging the default colors, or swapping in some of the undocumented alternate colors in the range 128-143:

128	129	130	131
132	133	134	135
136	137	138	139
140	141	142	143

See Palette for many more details, as well as the specific RGB values for each palette color, which may be useful in external editors or on the web.

--     == platforming engine ==
--     ==in 100 lines of code==
           
--the goal of this cart is to 
--demonstrate a very basic
--platforming engine in under
--100 lines of *code*, while
--still maintaining an organized
--and documented game. 
--
--it isn't meant to be a demo of
--doing as much as possible, in
--as little code as possible.
--the 100 line limit is just 
--meant to encourage people 
--that "hey, you can make a game'
--with very little coding!"
--
--this will hopefully give new 
--users a simple and easy to 
--understand starting point for 
--their own platforming games.
--
--note: collision routine is
--based on mario bros 2 and 
--mckids, where we use collision
--points rather than a box.
--this has some interesting bugs

## Code homework

For homework this week you will play Pico-8 platformers and begin to make your own.

* Create a character sprite in the sprite editor. At this point, you only need a single sprite to represent the character, but in the future you can add a walk cycle animation.
* Create background graphics sprites that will be used in your game. Things you may need: wall, floor, platform, exit (a flag?).
* Use the map editor to draw the level with your sprites
* Add your code to control the character and move through your level
* Add jumping and any other mechanics (gravity)
* Create an end state when the player reaches the goal
