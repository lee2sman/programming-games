# Finite State Machine Concept

A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract "machine" that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. 

The behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented. Simple examples are: vending machines, which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited; elevators, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders; traffic lights, which change sequence when cars are waiting; combination locks, which require the input of a sequence of numbers in the proper order.

An example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a state machine is a turnstile. A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.

Considered as a state machine, the turnstile has two possible states: Locked and Unlocked. There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and pushing the arm (push). In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input push is given, it stays in the locked state. Putting a coin in ‚Äì that is, giving the machine a coin input ‚Äì shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a push input, shifts the state back to Locked.

The turnstile state machine can also be represented by a directed graph called a state diagram (above). Each state is represented by a node (circle). Edges (arrows) show the transitions from one state to another. Each arrow is labeled with the input that triggers that transition. An input that doesn't cause a change of state (such as a coin input in the Unlocked state) is represented by a circular arrow returning to the original state. The arrow into the Locked node from the black dot indicates it is the initial state. 

## Title Screen or Menu

### Initializing 

The love.load() happens once at the state. We set the game state to the initial state.

```lua
function love.load()
  state=="title-screen"
end
```

### Update

The love.update() is where gameplay elements are changed (like a timer).

The update checks which state we are in and runs the correct update code depending on that state. 


```lua
function love.update()
  if state=="title-screen" then
    update_title_screen()
  elseif state=="gameplay" then
    update_gameplay()
  end
end
```

### Drawing

The function love.draw() is called to draw things to the screen. There's some repetition in this one. Compare to our love.update() function above.

```lua
function love.draw()
  if state=="title-screen" then
    draw_title_screen()
  elseif state=="gameplay" then
    draw_gameplay()
  end
end
```

### The rest of our update code, and changing states

In our 2 state diagram from above, translated to code below:

To change states:

* In our keypressed function (which runs every time a key is pressed), we check if we are in the title-screen state. If we are and the player has pressed return then we change to the gameplay state. 
* In our gameplay update function, if the player's lives are less than 1, change state back to title-screen.

```lua
function love.keypressed(key, scancode, isrepeat)
  if state=="title-screen" then
    if key == "return" then
      state=="gameplay"
    end
  end
end

function update_title_screen()
  --title screen update code
end

function update_gameplay()
  --gameplay update code
  --move enemies (change their x,y positions)
  --move player based on key presses
  if player.lives<1 then
    state=="title-screen"
  end
end
```

### More states

<figcaption><em>A finite state machine graph of a game with 3 levels</em></figcaption>

You can add more states to your game. It pays to draw a diagram first and then to turn that into code.

Below is an example update function checking for variosu states:

```lua
function love.update()
    if state=="animation" then
	  update_anim()
    elseif state=="startscreen" then
	  update_startscreen()
    elseif state=="info" then
	  update_startscreen()
    elseif state=="dead" then
	  update_dead()
    else
	  update_game()
    end
end
```

Inside each of these update functions you would be checking for various events to occur (pressing a button to start, losing all lives, etc) and then changing the state based on the event.

The updates are paired with related functions called in love.draw().

```lua
function love.draw()
    if state=="animation" then
	  draw_anim()
    elseif state=="startscreen" then
	  draw_startscreen()
    elseif state=="info" then
	  draw_howtoplay()
    elseif state=="dead" then
	  draw_dead()
    else
	  draw_game()
    end
end
```

#  Distributing your game

You made a game, and you want to share it with others. You could make them install L√ñVE on their computer, but that is not necessary.

First, we need to change the title and icon. For that we will use a config file.

Create a new file called conf.lua, and put in the following code

```lua
function love.conf(t)
	t.window.title = "Panda Shooter!"
	t.window.icon = "panda.png"
end
```

Save the file. Now when you run the game you'll see the game has the title "Panda Shooter!", and that the icon is the panda.

This is what the config file is for. L√ñVE loads `conf.lua` before it starts the game and applies the configurations. For a full list of options check out the [wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Config_Files).

Now that our game has the correct title and icon, let's turn it into an executable.

First we need to package our game in a zip file. Go to the folder of your game, select all the files. Now right click, go to *Send to* and click on *Compressed (zipped) folder*. The filename is not important, but we need to change the extension to `.love` (by default `.zip`).

*Note: This part is Windows only. Go [here](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution) to get info on building your game for other platforms.*

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/compress.png">

**If you can't see file extensions**

Press ***Windows + pause/break***. In the upper-left corner of the new opened window click on ***Control Panel***. Now go to ***Appearance and Personalization***.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/control_panel.png">

Click on ***File Explorer options***.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/personalization.png">

A new window opens. Click on the tab ***View***. In ***Advanced options***, make sure that ***Hide extension for known filetypes*** is unchecked.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/folder_options.png">

I wrote a bat file that packages the game for you. Download [this zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xX49nDCI0UxjnwY3-h0f-kpdmHVmNqvz/view?usp=sharing), and unzip all the files in a folder.

Now move your `.love` file on top of `build.bat`. This creates a `.zip` file in the same folder. This is the file that you will want to share with people. They have to extract all the files in a folder and open the `.exe` file.

Now you need to find a place to share your game. Check out [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

For more information on building your game, check out the [L√ñVE wiki page](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution) for it. It also tells you how to build your game for other platforms.

## Summary

With [conf.lua](https://love2d.org/wiki/Config_Files) you can configure things about your game like title and icon. Select all the files in the folder of your game, put them in a zip. Change the file's extension from `.zip` to `.love`. Download [this zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xX49nDCI0UxjnwY3-h0f-kpdmHVmNqvz/view?usp=sharing), and unzip all the files in a folder. Move your `.love` on top of `build.bat` to create a `.zip`. People will have to unzip all the files in a folder and open the `.exe` to play your game. We can also use Castle which is a client that allows us to share our L√ñVE games.
